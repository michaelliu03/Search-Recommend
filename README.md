# Search-Recommend-InAction
This is a book about search & recommendation. The publisher of the book is mechanical industry press. The book mainly summarizes and introduces some algorithms and architecture design about search & recommendation

This book is a practical dictionary of search and recommendation system for beginners. On the one hand, it accurately introduces the theoretical basis, working principle and common architecture of the search and recommendation system; On the one hand, it deeply explains the application scenarios, main algorithms and their implementation, engineering practice cases of AI technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing in search and recommendation system.

The book consists of 12 chapters and is divided into four parts.

The first part (Chapter 1-3) is the foundation of search and recommendation system

This paper first introduces the basic knowledge of probability statistics and applied mathematics, then introduces the common sense of search and recommendation system, and finally introduces the basic theory of knowledge mapping.

The second part (Chapter 4-6) search system principle and architecture

Firstly, the architecture and principle of the search system are explained to help readers understand the composition and working principle of the search system and the application of knowledge map in the search system; Secondly, the basic model, machine learning and deep learning algorithm involved in the search system are explained; Finally, the index system of evaluation search system is explained.

The third part (Chapter 7-9) the principle and architecture of recommender system

Firstly, the architecture and principle of recommender system are explained; Secondly, the linear model, tree model and deep learning model are introduced; Finally, the index system of evaluation recommendation system is explained.

The fourth part (Chapter 10-12) practical application

Firstly, three common search engine tools are introduced, including Lucene, Solr and elastic search; Secondly, it explains the application of search system and recommendation system; Finally, it introduces how to combine AI and engineering to play a role in industry.
